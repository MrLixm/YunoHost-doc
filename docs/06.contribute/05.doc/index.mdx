title: Write documentation
---

## Via GitHub

The YunoHost documentation is managed through a [Git repository](https://github.com/YunoHost/doc).

If you are not familiar with GitHub, there is an "Edit" button at the bottom of each page that will redirect you to the GitHub online editor that will help you make change proposals (Pull Requests, PR).

However, if you are on an editing spree, you should fork the repository. You can then make all the commits (changes) you want on your forked repository, and submit them all at once in the same pull requests. GitHub's etiquette would advise you to gather in the same PR all related commits.

Because the online editor doesn't support uploading files, using Git is the prefered way if you need to upload media (e.g. images).

## Docusaurus

The documentation is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io). It generates static pages that can be served by a simple server.

:::tip
The [official Docusaurus doc](https://docusaurus.io/docs/docs-introduction) should be your primary source of documentation.
:::

Install Docusaurus and its dependencies:

```bash
$ yarn
```

### Local development

Start a local development server, that automatically updates when files are edited:

```bash
$ yarn start
```

### Build

Build the final static files:

```bash
$ yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory.

:::tip
You can serve those files locally using `yarn serve`
:::

### Deploy

You can either copy the built files to a static file server (using [My Webapp](https://apps.yunohost.org/app/my_webapp)) or [deploy the site to Github Pages](https://docusaurus.io/docs/deployment#deploying-to-github-pages).

## Contents of the repository

## Special pages

Some pages of the documentation are automatically or dynamically generated.
