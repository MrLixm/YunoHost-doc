# Install YunoHost

Once you've decided [how and where to install YunoHost](/admin/self_hosting), you can:

* install the base Debian system (for some machines only)
* install YunoHost itself
* [run the post-install](/) where you'll create your first administrator

and your YunoHost will be ready to be used!
